/* here is the ipc protocol implemented in this file(server) and notwc-ipc(client):
 *  - there is a pipe called PIPE_NAME opened by the server
 *  - clients who want to subscribe to the ipc to receive events should open another pipe,
 *    and then send the new pipes name to PIPE_NAME and add \x1E to the end to signalize end of message
 *  - server will then open the new pipe and start sending down all the events
 *  - if a client wants to stop receiving events it just needs to close the file descriptor */
